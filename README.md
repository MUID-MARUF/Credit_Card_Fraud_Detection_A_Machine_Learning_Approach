This is my machine learning project where I've trained models to predict fraud credit card transactions.
The data was collected from Kaggle.
Size of the data is also 3 lakhs, however, it's clean data but a bit imballanced. 11.7% of the cases are fraud and the others are normal transaction. 
The data has no null values.
Before training models, the dataset is splitted into 70% & 30% for training and testing respectively. 

The six models are - 
1. Logistic Regression
2. Naive Bayes
3. K- Nearest Neighbour
4. XGBoost
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Forest
The XGBoost shows most accuracy almost 94.3%.

To run the project, just download and extract the file and run it using Anaconda(Recommanded) or Google Collab.
